# Lesson summary of branch 1:
I. Setup Go-GORM-RESTful-API-Project:
   1. What is ORM (Object Relational Mapping)?
      - A technique that allows developers to use their native programming paradigm(mô hình) to query, manipulate data stored in Database.
      - It provides a data mapper pattern to transform data defined in classes / objects to SQL.
      - It came with CRUD functions already implemented making it easier for developers to perform CRUD operations against the database.
      - Golang has built a number of developer-friendly ORM libraries for developers to use JSON key:value pair syntax and encoding to map directly to any SQL database.

   2. Setup the Go project:
      a. Init a new Golang project:
         - Initialize a Go module
      b. Create a Docker PostgreSQL Server (use Docker to run the Postgres server which could contain many databases):
         - Create a PostgreSQL Docker Container:
            * Create "docker-compose.yml" with configs:
               _ To manage an instance of PostgreSQL.
               _ Map our local port 6500(port at local machine) to the Postgres default port 5432(inside the container):
                  => Allow us to connect and access our running PostgreSQL server outside the container.
               _ Create a named "volume" to prevent data loss when deleting the Postgres container.
               _ Run "docker-compose up -d": to start the Postgres Docker container in detached mode.
      c. Load and Validate the Environment Variables(app.env) with Golang Viper:
         - "go get github.com/spf13/viper"

II. Template for environment variables ("app.env" file):
      POSTGRES_HOST = ...
      POSTGRES_USER = ...
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD = ...
      POSTGRES_DB = ...
      POSTGRES_PORT = ...

      PORT = ...
      CLIENT_ORIGIN = ...

      ACCESS_TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY = ...
      ACCESS_TOKEN_PUBLIC_KEY = ...
      ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRED_IN = ...
      ACCESS_TOKEN_MAXAGE = ...

      REFRESH_TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY = ...
      REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRED_IN = ...
      REFRESH_TOKEN_MAXAGE = ...
